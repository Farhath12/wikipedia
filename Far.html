    <p id="content1">Deverakonda Vijay Sai (born 9 May 1989)[1] is an Indian actor and film producer who
        predominantly works in Telugu
        cinema.[2][3]

        Deverakonda made his Telugu debut with Nuvvila (2015) and then played a supporting role in Yevade Subramanyam
        (2015). He established himself as a leading actor with Pelli Choopulu (2016), Arjun Reddy (2017), Mahanati
        (2018), Geetha Govindam (2018), Taxiwaala (2018) and Dear Comrade (2019). His portrayal of a self-destructive
        alcoholic in Arjun Reddy won him Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[4][5] He also won the SIIMA Best Actor
        (Critics) Award for Geetha Govindam.[6]

        Deverakonda also owns his own production house, King of the Hill Entertainment that had its first release with
        Meeku Maathrame Cheptha (2019).[7][8] In 2019, he was featured by Forbes India in their 30 Under 30 list,[9] and
        became the most searched South Indian actor according to Google's annual report.[10]</p>

    <p id="content2">Deverakonda's first lead role was in Pelli Choopulu, a romantic coming-of-age film directed
        by Tharun Bhascker.
        The film became commercially successful and won the Best Feature Film in Telugu and the Filmfare Award for Best
        Film – Telugu at the 64th National Film Awards.[21][22] He starred in the masala film, Dwaraka in 2017. His next
        film Arjun Reddy received praise and criticism alike for being very bold and radical.[23] Vijay's portrayal as a
        self-destructive, short-tempered, and alcoholic surgeon received critical acclaim, and won him awards like the
        Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[24][25] In 2019, Film Companion ranked Deverakonda's performance in
        Arjun Reddy in "100 Greatest Performances of the Decade".[26]

        Following Arjun Reddy was Ye Mantram Vesave, which was supposed to release in 2013 but released on 2018. He then
        starred in Mahanati, a biographical film around the life of actress Savitri. Deverakonda's next release in 2018
        was Geetha Arts' romantic comedy Geetha Govindam, in which he starred as an innocent and nervous college
        professor. His next film, released on 5 October, was the Tamil political thriller NOTA, directed by Anand
        Shankar, which performed poorly at the box office.[27] His next project was UV Creations' supernatural comedy
        thriller Taxiwaala.

        In 2019, Deverakonda was seen in Bharat Kamma's Dear Comrade, a romantic action drama, alongside Rashmika
        Mandanna. He later signed Hero, directed by Anand Annamalai co-starring Malavika Mohanan. But the film was
        reportedly shelved after beginning its production.[28] In 2020, he acted in Kranthi Madhav's romantic drama
        World Famous Lover opposite Raashi Khanna, Catherine Tresa, Aishwarya Rajesh, and Izabelle Leite.[29]</p>
